This repo contains the plotting scripts used to make the figures in the nonlinear spectroscopy paper:

The style used for all figures is controlled by `style.mplstyle`, but some scripts use internal rcParams for that particular plot.

Global settings, including the root directory where all data is loaded from, is controlled by `global_settings.py`, which is imported by all scripts.
